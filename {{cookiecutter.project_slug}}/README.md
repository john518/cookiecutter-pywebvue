# {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

A lightweight, high-performance desktop application built with Python (`pywebview`), a native local backend, and a Vue/Vite reactive UI (`ui/`).

## Overview

[Provide a brief description of what this custom desktop utility does.]

## Core Features

- **Modern Desktop Shell:** Wrapped via `pywebview` to leverage native OS rendering engines with minimal resource overhead.
- **Reactive UI:** Built using Vue.js and Vite inside the `ui/` directory.
- **Local Data Integration:** Communicates with local application backends or API layers.
